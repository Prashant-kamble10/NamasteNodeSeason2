Q. Difference btn package.json and package-lock.json

package.json
Purpose: This file lists the basic metadata for a project, including its dependencies, scripts, version, and other configurations.
Dependencies: It specifies the packages a project needs to run but doesn't lock them to exact versions by default (though you can specify exact versions if needed).
Usage: It’s used when someone installs a project, and npm uses it to install the latest versions of the dependencies that match the version ranges listed.
Manual Editing: You typically edit package.json manually to add scripts, dependencies, or configuration settings.


package-lock.json
Purpose: This file is automatically generated to lock the exact versions of all dependencies and their sub-dependencies. It ensures consistent installs across different environments.
Dependencies: It records the full dependency tree, locking each package to a specific version, ensuring reproducible builds.
Usage: When npm install is run, npm refers to package-lock.json to install exactly the same versions of dependencies as before, regardless of version updates.
Automatic Generation: This file is created and updated automatically by npm whenever dependencies change. You shouldn’t manually edit this file.
